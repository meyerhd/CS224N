enrononline 's auction functionality is very thin dealbench 's has a lot of good business logic built into it while the code might not be up to our standards it would be of value to integrate it into the enrononline platform this way we take advantage of the superior enrononline brand and not reinvent the wheel as far as business logic is concerned there will be some development needed to integrate and rewrite the dealbench auctions piece to accommodate the single enrononline login as well as change the look and feel to an enrononline one but this should be well worth it it is my strong belief that there is an untapped market for energy and commodity based auctions that enrononline should own as a part of this move we should re-deploy dealbench 's auction marketing force to attack this space which furthers the general commercial goals of ene as opposed to something that now is fringe at best 
thanks 
az 
i talked with greg and he and bibi are for it start the process with guadaramma but keep it close to the vest as it is not official with the dealbench folks 
thanks 
wasn 't me 
do we want to make this official 
give raj a call 
i do not want my name in the article please use greg piper 's or phillipe bibi 's 
thanks 
thanks for the note awaiting your review and response

i keep getting asked for a username password and domain name what do i put in these fields to get access 
kenny peggy mike 
we would definitely like to get this finished by end of june we can move as fast as you need us to ideally i would like both sides to get together early next to hash out any differences how does this work for you guys 
thanks 
az 
my pleasure 
claudio 
i agree with you the first bullet point will be easier to implement generally i have found that there is sufficient divergence of opinions amongst wholesale players that you can get positions on that you want 
my goal would be to fulfill the function of both bullet points i think there are pockets of risk management of complex relationships around the firm but no group dedicated to it clearly we will need quantitative rigor to serve those functions 
questions i am familiar with quantos from my banking days where a usd interest rate option pays off in a non usd currency at a fixed exchange rate what is the specific structure of the options you are looking at 
regards 
andy 
you 're right he does look good i am very interested can you set up a phone interview and if that goes well bring him down for rounds 
stu 
when you get a chance can you gice me a call re the above and natsource i 'm around most of tomrrow so any old time is fine with me 
thanks 
andy 
thanks 
i agree the whole thing is a sham 
fyi 
i think this warrants some investigation 
hi savita 
jennifer and i have been looking through the ice volumes on physical gas and it looks like nearly all of their really huge nat gas volumes are being done on firm physical custom trades it 's probably a good bet that these custom products are some sort of structured or one-off deals that are not available to the general trading public on their website but are instead closed large-scale transactions done between the various ice entities as a means of pumping up their volumes 
i 've gone through the attached spreadsheet and highlighted several examples of these custom deals and have spoken with bob shults to see if he has any contacts at ice that might be able to shed light on exactly what these things are he hasn 't called anyone yet however and i 've asked him not to until you and andy have had a chance to go over this 
could be something could be nothing 
torrey 
there are 2 sheets in the following attachment that contain enron transactional data for the intercontinental exchange ice and dynegy direct labeled as follows 
enron activity dynegy direct 
enron activity ice 
note total activity for dynegy direct is not available therefore enron 's percentage can not be calculated 
let me know if you have any questions or comments

i base my opinion on 15 years trading and marketing risk management products to corporations when i was at bankers trust every corporation we dealt with would ask after completing a deal can you tell us where we can get a cheap off-the-shelf system that we can use to manage these things 
the problem kiodex has is exactly what you describe with companies that where trading of derivative products is core to their mission the third party asp model is an extremely difficult one to sell there are all the obvious reasons security reliability continuity etc what kiodex needs to focus on in my opinion is the intersection of customers who need the product but don 't view the function as critical to their operation 
for what it is worth 
andy 
i agree completely we are the delivery vehicle for kiodex 
i hear shell 
i got this from ice thought you should have a look at it

i get a smattering of actual i tool the family down to corpus to the beach two weekends ago and half the flight was in and out of the clouds having a good auto-pilot and stormscope makes a diference but stormscopes can be tricky to use unless you have a lot of exprience the trick is never to put them on a setting of less than their maximum range or they never show you anything until it is too late i have the stormscope feeding through the garmin 530 keep flying 
i sold 2,000 d of apr oct 3.19 and 2,000 d 3.18 please put these in the ng-opt book not the jv book 
thanks 
jay 
thanks for the help 
andy 
it has the ho numbers but not the cl numbers 
jay that makes sense and is the right solution however i floated it by rob benson and dana davis and they felt that having to have another product up on the ir screen would but just too much go figure so they agreed to let me auto hedge to the base product and 5 min qty 5 increment works for me so we will run with that for the meantime the non web visible route is my back up 
i 'll let you know how it goes 
thanks 
andy 
don 't know about the aga seems to be that we are having harder and harder tme as an industry getting it right

andy 
after some preliminary analysis it does not look like our big counterparties i.e. dynegy rliant duke el paso etc are closing down their positions on the contrary their net positions seem to be rising this is only for nymex related financial instruments i haven 't looked at phys or power yet 
just thought you would like to know 
hi andy 
the following spreadsheets represent net generated positions on bullets and strips through the date indicated on the name of the spreadsheet i only looked back 90 days so it won 't include any of the strip trading not a lot done prior to july 25 if you want me to have these included let me know

small issue but annoying 
if try to modify a plo by going to the line and getting the box in the row with the order there is no way to change your mind and not modify without two error messages getting generated. i.e. if you decide to leave the price unchanged and hit set it generates the error messages there is no other way to get out of the window though no x box to close it 
hope all is well otherwise

screaming japanese schoolgirls overturn greenspan 's bus 
tokyo- federal reserve chairman alan greenspan described himself as shaken but all right monday following an incident in which several thousand excited young japanese fans mobbed and tipped over his tour bus after a speech at the tokyo dome mr. greenspan is at the height of his popularity in japan right now said martine engers a publicist for the chairman who is currently in the midst of a 41-city world tour and i guess we simply weren 't prepared for this level of fan hysteria before military police restored order thousands of frantically speculating youths drove the nikkei average past 16,000

who did it foreign report presents an alternative view 
israel 's military intelligence service aman suspects that iraq is the 
state that sponsored the suicide attacks on the new york trade center and 
the pentagon in washington directing the mission aman officers believe 
were two of the world 's foremost terrorist masterminds the lebanese imad 
mughniyeh head of the special overseas operations for hizbullah and the 
egyptian dr ayman al zawahiri senior member of al-qaeda and possible 
successor of the ailing osama bin laden 
the two men have not been seen for some time mughniyeh is probably the 
world 's most wanted outlaw unconfirmed reports in beirut say he has 
undergone plastic surgery and is unrecognisable zawahiri is thought to be 
based in egypt he could be bin laden 's chief representative outside 
afghanistan 
the iraqis who for several years paid smaller groups to do their dirty 
work were quick to discover the advantages of al-qaeda the israeli sources 
claim that for the past two years iraqi intelligence officers were shuttling 
between baghdad and afghanistan meeting with ayman al zawahiri according 
to the sources one of the iraqi intelligence officers salah suleiman was 
captured last october by the pakistanis near the border with afghanistan 
the iraqis are also reported to have established strong ties with imad 
mughniyeh 
we 've only got scraps of information not the full picture admits one 
intelligence source but it was good enough for us to send a warning six 
weeks ago to our allies that an unprecedented massive terror attack was 
expected one of our indications suggested that imad mughniyeh met with some 
of his dormant agents on secret trips to germany we believe that the 
operational brains behind the new-york attack were mughniyeh and zawahiri 
who were probably financed and got some logistical support from the iraqi 
intelligence service sso 
mughniyeh was the only one believed to have tried it before on april 12th 
1997 he was reported to be only two hours away from achieving the highest 
goal of any terrorist organisation until last week blowing up an israeli 
el-al airliner above tel aviv a man carrying a forged british passport with 
the name andrew jonathan neumann was in a jerusalem hotel preparing a bomb 
he was supposed to take on board an el-al flight leaving israel when it 
accidentally went off andrew jonathan neumann was very badly injured but 
strong enough to reveal later to the israelis that he was not british but 
lebanese and that his operation was supposed to be a special gift to 
israel from imad mughniyeh 
a psychopath 
bin laden is a schoolboy in comparison with mughniyeh says an israeli who 
knows mughniyeh the guy is a genius someone who refined the art of 
terrorism to its utmost level we studied him and reached the conclusion 
that he is a clinical psychopath motivated by uncontrollable psychological 
reasons which we have given up trying to understand the killing of his two 
brothers by the americans only inflamed his strong motivation 
experts on iraq and saddam hussein also believe that iraq was the state 
behind the two terror masterminds in recent months there was a change 
and iraq decided to get into the terror business on july 7th they tried 
for the first time to send a suicide bomber trained in baghdad to blow up 
tel aviv airport foreign report no. 2651 
our sources believe that it will be very difficult to get to the bottom of 
this unprecedented terror operation however they believe the chief of the 
iraqi sso is qusai hussein the dictator 's son and his organisation is the 
most likely to have been involved 
mughniyeh 48 is a sick man says an intelligence officer who was in 
charge of his file he is considered by western intelligence agencies as the 
most dangerous active terrorist today he is wanted by several governments 
and the americans have put a 2m reward on his head 
detailed list of mughniyeh operations removed for non-subscriber extract 
it was the assassination of one man in march 1984 that is said to have made 
mughniyeh the cia 's most wanted terrorist mughniyeh allegedly kidnapped the 
head of the cia station in beirut william buckley the kidnapping triggered 
what later became known as irangate when the americans tried to exchange 
buckley and others with arms for iran however the attempt ended in a 
fiasco by one unconfirmed account mughniyeh tortured and killed buckley 
with his own hands 
a year later in a combined cia mossad operation a powerful car bomb went 
off at the entrance to the house of hizbullah 's spiritual leader sheikh 
muhammad hussein fadlallah seventy-five people were killed one of them was 
his brother hunted by the cia and the mossad mughniyeh hid in iran 
in february 1992 israeli helicopter gunships attacked the convoy of the 
then head of hizbullah sheikh abas musawi in south lebanon musawi his 
wife and children were killed and the revenge attack followed a month later 
according to press reports mughniyeh was called back into action and in a 
well-planned and devastating attack his people blew up the israeli embassy 
in argentina the building was demolished and 92 were killed only last 
year after a long investigation did argentina issue a warrant for 
mughniyeh 's arrest 
the reprisal for the attack in argentina came in december 1994 when a car 
bomb went off in a southern shi 'ite suburb of beirut four people were 
killed one of them was called mughniyeh but to the deep disappointment of 
those israelis who planted the bomb it was the wrong one mughniyeh 's life 
was saved but his other brother fuad was killed mughniyeh waited for his 
opportunity for revenge 
our israeli sources claim to see mughniyeh 's signature on the wreckage in 
new york and washington how to counter this kind of terrorism to fight 
these bastards you don 't need a military attack said an experienced 
israeli commando officer you only need to adopt israel 's assassination 
policy 
some interesting facts and info 
hello friends 
for those of you who i have not spoken to i hope with 
all my heart family and friends are safe the victims 
will not be forgotten 
i would like to engage all of you in a discussion of 
what is to come or perhaps i 'm ranting you decide 
my first reactions like many others were decimation 
selected occupation no more standing military slowly 
over the course of 30-50 years we bring these nations 
into the fold of economic prosperity this has worked 
before but will it now on terrorism and 
intelligence i think terrorism is not to be treated 
as criminal law we cannot follow the diplomatic code 
when dealing with terrorist organizations i.e. our 
intelligence should be permitted to assassinate these 
people or have moles on the payroll 
after a few days of kill em all mentality i decided 
to begin my education in this matter i would like to 
share with you my first research and some impressions 
i do feel more informed my resolve is no different 
but my initial general blood thirst is evolving into 
something far more calculated 
domestic and international terrorism has been a 
horrible problem for as long as most nations can 
remember there is on average more than one terrorist 
event a day in the world in the late 1980 's it was 
as high as 2 events a day 
this is terrorism from colin powell himself i 
found myself numb before i event got through the first 
months of 2000

start with al quida a focal point or umbrella 
organization for a worldwide network that includes 
many sunni islamic extremist groups such as egyptian 
islamic jihad some members of al-gama 'at 
al-islamiyya the islamic movement of uzbekistan and 
the harakat ul-mujahidin 
al-qaida an terrorist organization almost run by bin 
laden financially his network is like a holding 
company al quida exerts heavy influence over the 
four organizations listed below each of the other 
organizations in turn exerts influence over other 
terrorist groups most of these are fundamental 
islamic extremist organizations a fear is that a 
general cohesive theme is to overthrow the 
middle-eastern governments establish fundamentalist 
islamic states which would persecute other religious 
observers within their borders wage war on western 
influence internally and potentially engage in 
military actions against the united states and other 
western nations

geography very good idea to look at maps of the 
region 
http www.randmcnally.com http www.randmcnally.com 
i found the geography interesting to study in detail 
afghanistan is horribly difficult to access the 
ocean-to-land access is through pakistan 's arabian sea 
coast then head north 800 miles to peshawar and then 
into kabul the mountainous route the british used in 
1946 the pakistan army is 50 taliban sympathetic 
already 42 political parties have issued statements of 
opposition to their own government for offering to 
help america they will descend into civil war most 
surely the hum will likely be a significant part of 
that problem it will do us no good to partner with a 
cooperative government and an uncooperative military 
could american planes be shot down over pakistan by 
renegades within their own army 
things we should know 
in pakistan many afghan refugees were initially 
trained by the us and pakistan intelligence isi in 
the 1980 's to fight the soviets they were called the 
mujahideen many were children living in refugee 
camps when recruited having known nothing else in 
this world left to their own devices for 10 years 
these camps and training centers have given root to 
terrorist organizations hum and violently 
anti-humanitarian fundamentalist movements the 
taliban the taliban gained control of afghanistan 
in 1996 overthrowing the then shiite-communist regime 
killing and hanging the president in downtown kabul 
for several days the taliban are sunni muslim 
fundamentalists and conduct a religious proletariat 
they terrorize other muslim communities the hazaras 
and hindu kush people within their borders the 
taliban recently issued an edict requiring afghan 
hindus to wear identifications tags sound familiar 
the taliban is hosting al qaida bin laden 's 
organization bin laden also influences the 
fundamentalist imu in uzbekistan the imu is 
another sunni fundamentalist terrorist group they 
are mostly involved in terrorizing uzbekistan 
kyrgyzistan and tajikistan north of afghanistan 
the taliban constituents are predominantly from the 
pushtun region pushtun covers parts of afghanistan 
and pakistan there have been movements to create a 
separate pushtunistan this map indicates the ethnic 
breakdown in the region 
http www.lib.utexas.edu maps middle east and asia pakistan ethnic 80.jpg 
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/pakistan_ethnic_80.jpg> 
and the hum focuses their attacks on india 
the shi 'ite muslims many other sunni muslims and in 
general the world muslim community do not agree with 
the taliban 's interpretation of islamic law the 
taliban is not accepted by most of the islamic world 
because of their extreme harshness and treatment of 
women total eliminations of all modern culture and 
being the worlds largest heroin production the 
elimination of western influence is not considered a 
problem within some other fundamentalist groups 
afghanistan is not friendly with neighbor iran to it 's 
west iran is an shi 'a or shi 'ite muslim nation 
because iran is predominantly shi 'a they are 
unfriendly with the more radical sunni dominated 
afghanistan iran backs the ousted government and is 
angered by taliban terrorism and slaughtering of 
thousands of shi 'a muslims including iranian 
diplomats in afghanistan iran also has border 
disputes with iraq further to the west even after a 
devastating 8 year war afghanistan and iraq are both 
25 million people iran is closer to 65 million

also during the war with soviet over 10 million land 
mines were dropped in afghanistan with no maps left 
behind 
http www.afghan-network.net landmines 
http www.afghan-network.net landmines 
the only opposition to the taliban is the northern 
military alliance these people are also sunni muslim 
and ethnically are the tajiks their leader massoud 
was killed last week assassinated by men posing as 
the press the sliver of afghanistan they still 
control is the finger squeezed between northern 
pakistan and southern tajikistan and touching china 
the tajik presence cannot be eliminated by the taliban 
without initiating conflict with tajikistan the nma 
is a political authority that may be put in place 
they have offered 15000 soldiers and 15000 more on 
reserve their leader was killed last week most 
likely in some coordinated effort along with the new 
requirement that all organization in afghanistan need 
to put monies in to the afghan bank many acts were 
clearly coordinated in this event 
i have also been seeking out information on the 
taliban in particular these link contain some very 
powerful information quite frankly it is shameful 
that the western world turned their back when this 
hellish situation was brought on upon afghanistan many 
years ago 
first a super high level overview it is interesting 
to note how many times this land has been ravaged by 
invaders

try to digest this information it is very important 
that initiate an informed dialogue but the taliban 
must go 
this section is organized geographically based on the 
waterways 
the nations in question will need to eradicate expel 
extremists from within their own borders this means 
partnering with a united states led coalition and 
contributing emphatically 
look at the mediterranean coast 
the south morocco algeria libya and egypt are all 
plagued by terrorism 
the east israel lebanon syria all plagued by 
terrorist groups there is a dreadful rooting of 
terrorist organization beirut was once a beautiful 
city i am told for 20 years it has replaced warsaw as 
the pop-culture reference to a war torn city 
terrorism surrounding israel ties into several other 
organizations including hizbollah and hamas 
look at the red sea 
egypt sudan and saudi arabia the sudan is terribly 
infiltrated this may be the terrorist plan hatching 
ground and safe haven and while the saudi 's are 
economically partnered with the western world many 
extremists operating out of saudi do fund these 
organizations sudan is also suspected of being a 
meeting ground for the terrorist network 
look at the gulf of aden entrance to the red sea 
yemen has allowed bin laden to broadcast site of 
the uss cole bombing after the attack the 
perpetrators fled from yemen to afghanistan 
rounding the corner into the persian gulf 
saudi arabia and the united arab emirates both 
acknowledge the taliban government they have 
provided radical nationals to the afghans throughout 
the years many support the taliban some trained with 
bin laden we hope these governments have a change of 
heart with regard to recognition of the taliban 
iran persia until 1935 has coastal territory along 
the gulf and the caspian sea to the north we have 
had problems with iran in the past in the current 
situation they may be helpful maybe not there is 
information pointing to an islamic conference in 
tehran which is another possible hatching ground for 
these operations iran still may be a very serious 
issue in the future it is a religious government 
something we all implicitly abhor in this nation 
they exiled the shah and began systematically 
eliminating western influence from their society after 
the event in 1979 
iraq part of the ottoman empire through 1932 
kurdish territory in the north bordering on turkey 
hussein has used sarin nerve gas against his own 
nationals the kurds in the north near the turkish 
border as we know he has invaded kuwait an 8 year 
war with iran over borders was going on at the same 
time the soviets were in afghanistan this is a 
military regime though the economic sanctions we 
have used for the last 10 years have kept iraq down as 
military force they have created a new generation of 
hatred 
east from the gulf into the arabian sea part of the 
indian ocean the arabian basin is separated from the 
indian ocean by underwater land structure but there is 
nothing to prevent sea travel 
pakistan a country on the verge of civil war a 
military regime probably half of the people in the 
army are taliban sympathizers pakistan may be in 
civil war shortly 
india the largest democracy in the world still 
disassembling the 3500 yr old caste system the 
british occupation left india with an intact system of 
representative government they are plagued by 
internal strife from the sikh who are separatists 
their brand of terrorism has been significantly 
reduced in the past 8 years they are also plagued by 
the hum another extremist fundamental islamic movement 
very closely connected to the taliban and bin laden 
as described earlier 
china actually shares a thin strip of border with 
afghanistan near tajikistan pakistan also borders on 
china though the himalayas separate the bulk of this 
geographically from the 1 billion people of china 
having china on board is critical 
i would like the us to investigate tsi telephone 
services international a new jersey corporation and 
unocal a california oil company both of these 
companies have had business dealings with the taliban 
government i believe that corporate greed with total 
disregard for the human condition in any country is 
unacceptable and should be uncovered and dealt with 
accordingly and i think the investment community 
needs to demonstrate in the markets to corporations 
who dabble in business with terror linked 
organizations the investment community was hit 
particularly hard i hope going forward there will be 
a clear message to stop support for companies who may 
potentially aggravate terrorists to attack americans 
we may need to legally restrict what our corporations 
can do abroad and who they are allowed to strike deals 
with based on the opportunity cost of potential 
terrorist activity by all means no corporation 
should have had any business dealings with the 
taliban perhaps this should be enforced by law 
some rants about waking the sleeping giant mind 
i firmly believe that the deadened state of 
intellectual discussion concerning these issues in 
america is part of the problem 
we have been funneling our best minds into technology 
banking law and medicine for a very long time the 
general lack of information and interest in world 
political and human conditions and the evolution of 
human governments is dangerous the average american 
simply need to be more informed and have an opinion to 
express to our government on what we can do to ensure 
the survival of our way of life and the spread of 
goodwill 
most likely we are all in agreement that a forceful 
military strike will initiate this new campaign i 
think there is quite a bit of confusion over what we 
really are about to embark on our army may well 
include the corporate army and the casualties will be 
civilian we need to get every american to study this 
condition it 's roots causes directions and what we 
can do to end it americans need to start an 
intelligent dialogue around the country publicly so 
that we can demonstrate to ourselves and the rest of 
the world that we are educated and serious about 
achieving a solution our military domination is 
already known throughout the world 
perhaps our long-term goal may involve bolstering the 
middle-class communities in these nations assuming 
they are moderate tolerant and peace-loving they 
need something to lose and conversely something to 
protect to get there we will need to eradicate any 
fundamentalist governments like the taliban under no 
circumstances can they be trusted going forward ever 
we will need to partner with each nation and hunt the 
terrorist organizations down within their borders we 
need to seize assets disable communications engage 
in an unprecedented intelligence campaign 
let 's focus our efforts on thinking and providing our 
leadership with a collective strategy and wisdom an 
opinion from within while i trust the powers that be 
to handle these affairs i never believed any day in 
my life that we were so vulnerable 
know the enemy the threat of bio-chemical weapons a 
simple overview of what the most likely agents are 
http abcnews.go.com sections science dailynews deadlygas0210.html 
http abcnews.go.com sections science dailynews deadlygas0210.html 
there is one company in america that is contracted by 
the dod to produce the anthrax vaccine the bioport 
corporation formerly known as the michigan biologic 
products institute mbpi i hope the defense around 
that company is solid 
hopefully this will generate some interest in 
developing a public discussion regarding strategies 
for the eradication of terrorism and governments that 
support them actively tacitly or otherwise bin 
laden imad mughniyeh head of the special overseas 
operations for hizbullah and the egyptian dr ayman 
al zawahiri senior member of al-qaeda and possible 
and the taliban should go first then perhaps 
the other organizations mentioned above then what 
hussein qaddafi will egypt be on board when the al 
jihad unleash terror in egypt do these nations host 
silently in exchange for less or no terrorism within 
their borders completely bending to the will of 
terrorists for fear of their people being injured is 
that support or a successful campaign of terror where 
do we draw the line i suppose where you stand after 
tuesday is a good start who 's next how do we 
prioritize will they are be lined up behind the us in 
1 year 
be strong be prepared be smart be heard god bless

glendale ca- rock guitarist steve vai wowed a group of neighborhood children with his spectacular guitar pyrotechnics monday his behind-the-head guitar solo was so wicked said jimmy hetzel 11 one of six children blown away by vai 's fretboard wizardry he also did this thing where he held the guitar between his legs and played it with a bow the impromptu performance is believed to be the most impressive display of its kind since september 2000 when joe satriani showed off a few licks at a southfield mi bar mitzvah

this is the interest rate curve we used to value our book as of close of business oct 15 2001 our treasury guys are either not available now or are not working anymore so for getting the term structure of enron 's funding costs for 10 15 01 i probably can 't deliver that today i still think your money desks and corporate traders could give you a pretty realistic picture of that i will keep trying though

andy zipper 
i 'm considering this terminated 
i would be happy to and yes you may use my name 
rick 
i 've been thinking about this i think 18 mos. for the average tenor of a trade is way too high for john arnold 's book it would on a prospective basis be more in line with 4 months we would probably not make markets online on anything past 24 months for nymex gas and the vast majority of our trades are in the first three months i think the same would probably be true for power but i haven 't spoken to those guys about it 
for the nymex book gas i made the following assumptions 
average tenor 5 months 
average trades per day 400 
average volume per trade 500,000 mmbtu 
average px 2.7 mmbtu 
with 252 trading days you and up with a gross unadjusted notional of 136bn this is simply 400 252 500,000 2.7 
you then have to adjust down for the expiration of trades during the year if the average life was 6 months you could halve the number above which would be conservative given our 4 month assumption 
that takes you down to 68.04bn 136bn 2 
the next adjustment would be to factor in netting for counterparties you are trying to estimate the net open interest per countperparty i am working on those numbers as i write this it stands to reason that the net number for nymex gas deals would be less than 70bn when you factor in other gas trades and power the number would rise and i will look at that 
as a basic method does this start to get you to where you need to be 
andy

greg we 've been able to load thousands of enrononline trades into our risk 
workbench and we 've correctly run risk reports on them might we be of 
service to enron by loading all the enrononline trades into the risk 
workbench and running our risk reports on the aggregate i 'm thinking that 
such an independent analysis of at least part of enron 's risk position might 
answer the requests expressed among analysts and pundits in the ft the 
wsj and elsewhere for greater disclosure 
everyone is excessively worried about mysterious packages these days just 
as enron pioneered transparency in the energy markets enron can set the 
gold standard for disclosure of aggregate risk i know the other dealers 
will want to squirm their way out of following suit i have supreme 
confidence in enron 's risk controls and i 'm thinking that an independent 
measurement of this kind could dispel the market 's overblown and baseless 
fears 
please let me know your thoughts

i know this has been a tough couple of weeks for you but i thought i would drop you a line and share my impressions 
1 this deal is an ideal opportunity to merge back and mid office support platforms we have discussed this many times and enronnetworks was practically set up for this commoditylogic et al 
2 i don 't know what you folks have in mind but i could see leaving ene 's market making and trading structure intact and having dyn 's asset-based trading be just another business unit like ees was. but the key is the tremendous cost savings of the common support platform 
i don 't mean to be presumptuous but i hadn 't talked to you in a while and wanted to get it off my chest 
good luck

unbelievable 
interesting is lay going to retire 
dj enron ceo -2 also to get reimbursed for tax penalties 
washington dow jones --enron corp. ene chief executive kenneth lay could 
receive a lump sum payment as much as 80 million as a result of dynegy inc s 
dyn plan to acquire enron according to a regulatory filing released tuesday 
by the securities and exchange commission 
under lay 's employment agreement which originally extended through dec 31 
2003 lay was entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of full 
calendar years remaining under his contract multiplied by 20.2 million if he 
terminated his employment within 60 days of a change of control 
in august lay chairman of enron resumed his position as ceo following the 
resignation of jeffrey k. skilling enron 's then-president and ceo at that 
time his contract was extended to dec 31 2005 
in addition to the lump sum payment lay is entitled to an amount for any 
related tax penalties if the payment were held to constitute an excess 
parachute payment according to the filing 
dynegy plans to acquire enron in a stock swap valued around 10.12 billion 
the deal is expected to close sometime next year in which case lay is 
entitled to 60.6 million under his contract if he terminates his employment 
within the 60 days

fyi 
hi andy 
when it was decided that we would accept multi-day orders we pointed out to lavo and john that we do system maintenance for an hour every friday night their position was anytime we take the system down for any reason planned or un-planned we should kill all orders to prevent someone from being unable to cancel an order while the system was down and then having it fill before he can get to it 
we actually have a plan in place to make this much better effectively we will have dual sites the second site will be used both for disaster recovery as well as a convenient way to manage code releases without an outage unfortunately purchasing the hardware for this has been put on hold given the present circumstances

i think the note i sent to steve plus the fact that he came to see me and i told him he was out of line are enough we will not support the app it seems kind of draconian to shut off the flow of information as far as wireless in general it has never been a high priority for me because we never had a commercial basis for proceeding other than gee wouldn 't this be cool i think it is time to reassess the wireless angle in terms of what it would cost to build who would build it for us and what we would get from the project i 'm going to ask dave forster to do that

okay it wil be bob shults i will put him in contact with joe 
please call joe robertson of enron metals in ny to discuss market-making deal with the comex 
i would like one of your guys to join joe robertson joe knows the contract and the market your guy knows the system and our vision for eol market making you name the guy 
joe 
mike 
there are lots of issues around this sort of deal who do want to negotiate this you or us 
this is the underlying deal. it needs work and i am not sure we would do it. also no straight through processing would be allowed for our deals 
mike 
i attach a letter of intent which i hope covers all the points we discussed this morning on the basis that you asked for a memorandum of understanding the attached draft is fairly legalistic in tone if you wanted something more informal let me know 
paul let me know if you have any comments 
jonathan 
i agree with kal 
i believe the attached note accurately summarizes our position we do not see anything changing the deal remains terminated for the reasons below 
on may 22 2001 houstonstreet representatives frank getman john wyman and david cuadros came to enron to give us a demonstration of the gas interfaces houstonstreet was allowed to load the required .cab files on the demonstration computers prior to the demonstration houstonstreet provided us with a script to follow relative to the demonstration as well as a list of test and production mappings during the demonstration we experienced the following 
1 8 second delays between a price update on enrononline and a price update on houstonstreet with just five products active we experienced a delay of up to 5 seconds due to the delay in price updates transaction attempts on the houstonstreet platform resulted in a high percentage of failed transactions with enron 
when we activated product id 16612 us gas basis pepl jun-oct01 the product showed up on enrononline but did not show up on houstonstreet houstonstreet provided us with a list of products which had been mapped in the test environment and this product was included on the list houstonstreet indicated that they had verified the mapping of all the products on this list we reviewed the mapping of this product by enron and confirmed that it was active and mapped incorrect mapping of products has the potential of allowing transactions to occur with mismatched product types 
when we attempted to transact on product id 16600 us gas basis ngi chicago jun-oct01 we were unable to complete a transaction even when the bid and offer prices were not changing these transaction attempts should have resulted in successful transactions we also experience instances where the bid and or offer price would disappear after a failed transaction attempt and not reappear even thought the price was still present on enrononline in many cases the price would disappear for up to 30 seconds or more although we did not witness any incorrect transactions general functionality failure may or may not result in incorrect transactions at a minimum this type of behavior would result in frustration on the part of the counterparty when a transaction attempt results in a failure with no subsequent price move or a disappearing price 
a review of the transactions we recorded versus the transactions indicated by houstonstreet reveals some discrepancies in an email from john wyman dated 5 23 forwarded seperately john wyman indicated that they had cleaned their database just prior to 3 00 pm and gave us just the trade count beginning at 14 58 on 5 22 although there has not been a deal by deal reconciliation of the trades we compared our total trade count beginning at 14 58 if the deal counts do not match this would result in substantial financial exposure below i have highlighted the houstonstreet transactions by counterparty versus the enrononline transaction count

the traders are free to use any platform they like i do not approve or disapprove they are in the best position to make that decision it is ews policy however that someone from amita lara 's group be the master user to montor activity and control what access agreements we accept 
thanks

lara 
you need to be the master user for the platform it is ews policy go ahead and get set up and coordinate document acceptance with justin 
guys 
let 's get together today to dicuss demo i would like to demo full capability including option manager i think it is very important to also set up an interest rate product perhaps a swap that is quoted in rate only no need to convert to dollar ox just yet given that the guy who is building their commercial paper platform will be there and seems to be one of the main judges of the merit of eol i think it behooves us to slant presentation that way 
i 'm good from 11 00 to 1 00

lot of weight and hasn 't been exercising at all dad 's pretty frustrated 
because all she does is watch tv i had a talk with her yesterday telling

cnn has learned of a possible connection between gurung and a man who is being held as a material witness in the september 11 terrorist attacks gurung listed the same west hollywood avenue address in chicago as the detainee full story 2001 us 11 05 inv.ohare.security.breach index.html 
in the u.s.-led retaliation for the terror attacks taliban forces were leaving their southern afghan stronghold of kandahar on monday as u.s.-led airstrikes intensified 
after a quiet day sunday allied planes dropped a single bomb southeast of the city cnn 's kamal hyder reported heavy bombardment of rural districts around kandahar as well as military targets to the northeast southeast and west 
there were reports of further attacks overnight on the kajaki dam area where a hydroelectric plant is located that provides power to kandahar 
taliban frontline positions north of kabul also were hit monday and there were reports of intense fighting near the strategic northern city of mazar-e sharif 
here is the position summary as of feb 2 2002 
during this critical time it is imperative that our management team remain focused on our business and continue to address the challenges currently facing our company for that reason i have decided to postpone the enron management conference 
the conference will now be held friday february 22 saturday february 23 2002 at the westin la cantera resort in san antonio while the saturday meeting allows some enron executives who cannot be away from the office during business hours to attend the management conference for the first time i also recognize that it requires many of you to forfeit additional personal time on behalf of enron i truly appreciate your sacrifice and i sincerely encourage your attendance 
the new agenda while still being finalized will be abbreviated but every bit as informative and worthwhile as previously planned we 'll be in touch soon with more details 
regards 
ken lay

today marks the completion of the 2 week commissioning period for adms 
effective october 26th at 16 00 the system controllers will no longer follow 
up adms dispatches with a voice confirmation unless a adms message has timed 
out because of technical difficulties or the system controllers have been 
notified that a participant is having technical difficulties receiving adms 
dispatches and directives 
the time out period will be adjusted from the 10 minutes to 5 minutes we 
intend to further reduce the time out to 2 minutes following a reasonable 
delay and reassessment based on our operating experience 
we are currently reevaluating the adms dispatch procedures with regards to 
the interconnections any changes to the interconnection procedures will be 
conveyed to participants well in advance of implementation 
thanks to all of you for your patience during our implementation of this

i never wrote nor implied that i was intending to hedge currency exposure with a third party i implied that i will hedge with you guys when and where i deem appropriate in the term structure 
john 
i don 't have all the facts around this transaction but i don 't think you are authorized to hedge currency exposure with outside counterparties as you 've outlined in your email to hickerson etc i 'd appreciate some information 
jeff 
you will violate enron policy if you do that

given the volatility in the gas market which is the sole impact on the canadian power book 's us dollar exposure and the exhorbitant cost involved in hedging multi-year cashflows i.e. as evidenced by friday 10 19 2001 trade of 1,200,000 cdn new deal value for the 14 year swap that i entered into i will manage the currency exposure of this book myself i will hedge appropriately when i see fit and will not accept hedges forced on enron canada because of arbitrary position limits set by your department 
john zufferli 
since alberta power trades 15 times day and east and west power trade in excess of 1000 times day i believe that a 10 allocation for my desk is inappropriate i would be willing to settle for 5 and i believe that this is more that generation

once again the eol report is ignoring the new customer list that i have given twice now they seem to insist that the the canadian subs that are now tradinig alberta power that have traded other products on eol are not new customers i have all but given up on this issue

guys i understand that you met with cross et al to discuss wholesale offers to retail my original position on the matter has not changed that is the wholesale desks need to show a wholesale offer to retail in other words the offer shown to our retail affiliate at a minimum should equal the offer that would be shown in our wholesale business either through eol brokers or the offer given to originators for wholesale customer deals 
there has been a great deal of discussion with respect to the margins retail is adding to the wholesale offer from a wholesale perspective this is irrelevant the retail business requires large margins due to its nature small vol high credit commission call centre invoicing etc 
the retail margin only becomes relevant if prices need to be tighter in those particular cases both parties need to work together to make sure that our price is ultimately competitive this may involve one or both parties reducing their imbedded margins and or offer 
i am looking to the two of you to help build the retail business your leadership and assistance are crititcal to the success of the retail initiative without your cooperation the business is dead you are both in a position of power to make or break the retail business in canada it is very clear that ees houston is relying heavily on lavo and his folks to push forward the retail business in the us it seems to be working we need to ensure that we are doing the same i can guarantee you that your efforts will not go unnoticed 
i understand that sharing the margin was discussed as an option this option will not work from an external perspective it is imperative that enron demonstrate its retail capabilities as well as retail earnings if a portion of retail margin remains in wholesale it does nothing for expanding the stock multiple i am convinced that the key lever to expanding our stock multiple lies with retail and therefore retail earnings 
if you have any questions or concerns i would be happy to discuss this further at the end of the day it is imperative that we are all on the same page 
regards 
rob

hi guys 
how are you feeling jess guess what i had a dream last night that i 
was 7 months pregnant it was so weird it totally felt real my 
parents didn 't know and they were coming up for a visit so i was trying 
to 
hide it with a baggy sweater suffice it to say when i woke up this 
morning i reached for my belly and was very happy to see it quasi-flat 
anyway i was wondering if you or john could send me directions of how to 
get to your house my friend josh will be driving in from saskatoon on 
the 
friday afternoon i 'm clueless as to which highways to take i 'm sure 
he 
can find his way to calgary but may just need to get around the city 
thnx i 'll call you guys before i leave for calgary on wednesday i 'm 
pretty nervous to fly but i 'll be more nervous on the way back because 
i 'll be alone my colleagues are going back on thursday 
talk to you soon 
lee 
i don 't have time to go to your office you have to come here i am in the process of setting curves between 3 and 4 i never know when i am done since i am dependent on houston currency and gas curves so if you could be here at 4 that would be good 
would like to grab an hour to discuss different go-forward edcc ecc pricing scenarios 
just get with me when you are in 
john 
i don 't disagree with any of the comments you made in my performance review but would still like to meet with you i 'd like to discuss some stuff relating to career development how i can improve some learning objectives etc can we set aside a half hour sometime this week or early next week please e-mail me the times that would work best for you

mark 
when is the interview date at wilfred laurier guelph and waterloo 
can they all be put on at the same time either on or off-campus 
do you still have the forms for the 4 hourly people tyler john mike murray i tried to go into the pep and get them but it is closed 
my understanding from hr in houston is that lavo has asked for a list of outstanding reviews there 's still a chance to slip under the radar if you get your outstanding reviews to me by tomorrow 
thanks 
john

thanks 
mark 
this is operational stuff i received from the power pool 
i seem to be receiving a lot of this kind of stuff and i think it is now appropriate for enron to change our designated contact person with the power pool from me to someone who is more operationally focused please let me know who you want to do that and i will advise the power pool of the change

thank you 
as most of you already know i am leaving enron after five years to go to harvard mba school my times at enron have been beyond the expectations that i had when i stepped into trading hourly power at odd hours of the night when i first became an enron analyst since the very beginning enron has given me the chance to demonstrate my talents and the chance to prove myself no other company would have given those chances at such a young age i like to think that i repaid the favor to at least some degree and am leaving enron a little stronger than it would have otherwise been 
even though i contemplated several other opportunities to leave over the last five years i never left for another company i came to realize that the people that work here are the best and i have always strived to be among the best aside from the professional skills and energy the people here have become good friends of mine enron is among the best corporations in the world because of the high quality of people that we have attracted over the years 
special thanks to jim fallon jeff golden mark muller dave delainey kevin presto and rogers herndon all of whom have provided me direction and excellent leadership during my time here 
please find my forwarding email address phone numbers and address if any of you need anything or come to boston please look me up i will always buy the first beer good luck to you all

have you reviewed that ladies resume that i gave you 2 weeks ago 
if so what do you think 
corporately we are not allowed to trade currency outside of houston in the same way we can 't make markets on other traders markets if eol has enough products in currency we may be able to post our numbers on the screen inside of the houston currency traders two-ways i am unsure if we are even allowed to do this 
hi john 
i am interested in started a currency trading desk in this office the ultimate goals of this would include providing tighter two-ways for our traders as well as improving our bottom line this would open up opportunity for investing in money markets outside of canada and the us the swiss franc rose 5.5 versus the us dollar last week and i think that we are currently missing out on excellent opportunities to increase our income i think i could make money at currency trading and this area shouldn 't be overlooked i understand that a substantial amount of preparation is required before this could happen let me know whether or not you think this may be feasible and we can take it from there

john 
can you confirm whether or not you guys had planned to launch physical gas from day 1 
dave 
i have forwarded you e-mail to john zufferli i don 't know who in canada had input into the cdn operations timetable but i would have thought we would have wanted some physical day 1 we have 5 of 8 traders here who are very very physical in what they have typically traded hopefully john can give you some further insight 
chris 
chris 
do you guys want to trade physical gas and power from day 1 
if so i note that cdn operations timetable identifies this as a post day 1 item as they think physical trades will not start until later

note about the meeting 
our suggestion regarding the tone of this meeting is to forge a stronger 
relationship between the market the members of the apma and the 
government the honorable minister of energy murray smith the meeting 
has been positioned with the minister 's office as a discussion forum around 
certain key fundamental topics see points 1 to 4 below 
if you would like to discuss other topics that interest your company please 
feel free to air these issues in the discussion 
we are suggesting that everything discussed in this form is held off the

potential subjects as relayed to the minister 's office 
1 what is the government planning to do with the electricity market 
over the past 12 months intervention by the government and governmental 
agencies drastically affected the market for electricity these actions 
caused dramatic sudden changes in forward market prices the apma members 
are concerned that this behavior often given the idiom reactionary 
regulation will persist 
2 what is the governments view on transmission lines to the us markets 
the prospect of transmission lines that would directly connect the alberta 
market with us market is an interesting subject to most power marketers 
what is the current position of the government on the how the building 
owning and marketing of these hypothetical transmission lines would work in 
the new market 
3 what is the government planning to with the remaining unsold ppa 
last years decision by the balancing pool to sell energy from the unsold 
power purchase arrangements in a single auction dramatically affected the 
forward market for electricity with the balancing pool still the 
custodian of the unsold ppas what is the plan going forward for the 
release of the unsold ppas into the market

not sure if you have seen this or not but i thought it was cute 
on july 26 2000 two friends jim and john each received a 1000 bonus 
at work 
they both work for nortel networks where in the summer of 2000 there 
was lots of money around for bonuses jim being an intelligent 
financially conscientious person put the whole 1000 into nortel 
networks stock with his 1000 and the transaction cost of 
35 he was able to purchase 7 shares at 123 each having watched the 
nortel stock climb and climb he felt very good about this investment 
happy that he is preparing for the future 
john being a more care-free sort did something slightly different with 
his 1000 john borrowed a friend 's truck and proceeded to the 
beer store where he purchased 33 cases of beer john also felt very 
good about his investment 33 cases x 24 is 792 bottles of beer john 
also 
being an intelligent guy although perhaps not as forward-thinking as 
jim calculated that he could drink about 15 bottles per week and he 
wouldn 't 
have to buy beer for a whole year 
jim of course was appalled by john 's purchase and berated him 
constantly about it as months went by jim excitedly watched the 
stock prices and saw it start to dwindle it 'll go back up he 'd say 
to jim jim who has been reaping the benefits of his investment 
on a daily basis would reply ya it will hang in there buddy burp 
months went by and the value of the stock continued to fall and there 
was the beginnings of a noticeable dent in the beer pile midwinter came 
jim 's stock had fallen to about half of it 's original value and john 's 
beer was about half gone jim being sure that the 
stock had hit rock-bottom still was berating john for his frivolous 
purchase telling him your beer will be gone in six months who knows 
what my stock will be worth 
well summer has come and hard times at nortel continue bad news both 
john and jim have been affected by the layoffs last week in order to 
raise some cash to help through the rough time jim sold his 7 shares at 
that day 's value of 12 and got 84 then after paying the 35 
transaction fee he only had 49 
jim stopped by john 's house later that day everyone needs their friend 's 
during rough times and as luck would have it there were 
two bottles of john 's beer left john being a good compassionate 
friend offered to share his last two bottles of beer with his friend 
jim appreciated the gesture and enjoyed the cold beer on the hot 
summer 's day but he felt a bit guilty 
at least i got fifty bucks back out of it you have nothing now he 
said that 's ok replied john perhaps you can help me i need to 
return all these empties he added as his other friend with the truck 
pulled in so they loaded up the truck and proceeded off to the beer 
store 
upon arrival at the beer store they unloaded the empties feeling a 
little grim john went to the counter and collected his refund for the 
bottles 33 cases x 24 bottles at 10 cents per bottle that comes to 
79.20 the friendly beer store clerk said to john as he handed him the 
money jim was speechless poor guy can you imagine how you would feel 
if you just discovered that over the course of the 
last year your 1000 stock investment left you with 50 and taking same 
1000 buying beer and drinking it would leave you with 80 i 'll leave 
it up to the reader to come up with they 're own moral to the story

regards nella 
i talked to milly yesterday he was ok with the concept of covering the 1 month salary i talked to trish and the easiest non-tax affected way to handle it is to submit expense forms the problem is if you sell the car at a loss then the loss compensation is tax deductible if you import the car then the transport costs imports duties can be submitted as an expense and is not exposed to taxes i talked to trish about exactly what you have proposed and she wasn 't sure from an equity standpoint between what was given to other employees that she could do that however don 't worry about it i 'll do my best so that you are kept whole in one way or another the easiest position for me to push is if you actually want to keep your car then you can expense the duty 
john 
did you have a chance to talk to dawn milly even if you want to work the flight hotel movers the usual way and then pay the balance as a signing bonus or something that would probably work i am going to take a bath on my car in a big way the option of moving my it back to canada is out of the question as i just found out i would have to pay 6.1 import duty 7 gst and about 400 in excise taxes and permits let me know 
chris 
now that we can post numbers inside other market maker 's numbers on eol i expect no one to go the broker market for products that you are not the primary market maker please mandate this policy with your traders as you always do let me know if you disagree 
with love

we are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live 
we need to make sure that your stack managers are accessing the correct database in order to do this we need to know how you access stack manager

i am interested in joining the gas trading team next summer as i will be graduating from the u of c in april i don 't know if i should try going through the fall recruiting or try a different route i have not talked to neither my superior peggy nor kathy yet 
i 've been with enron since october but i was will be again this fall doing support work for ryan watt and sometimes for mike cowan during the weekends i work with their supply and demand models calculate their positions schedule gas on the nova pipelines and work with the suncor and petrocanada accounts together with the outsourcing team over the summer i had the opportunity to work with kathy 's group to get some experience on the slightly more complex deal types that enron offers 
i had an interview with mckay back in early june however i guess back then i was doing summer classes the interview did not go as well as i hoped now with summer classes over i was just wondering if i could try again 
please let me know what you think and i look forward to your reply

give me a call after 3 00 pm mst tomorrow 
hi john 
nice to meet you by email and thank-you very much for making yourself available as a source of further info and assistance i 'm sure you have gotten a download that sets the context for us to have a conversation or two over the next little while i am actually flying to calgary tonight so i was going to try calling you tomorrow morning however as a trader would you prefer not to receive any calls during business hours if so when is a good time to be on the phone for 25min please let me know 
per your relayed request i have also attached a current resume in addition i have pasted in some bullet points from a recent cover letter that outline what i am interested in pursuing and what i bring to the table i 'm primarily interested in tapping you for some energy industry knowledge and a sense of your experiences we 'll see what else can happen from there 
thanks again for making yourself available and hopefully we can hookup soon have a great day 
andy crysdale 
what i bring to the table 
capabilities i have developed a broad set of analytic communication and project management skills and experience i have leveraged these skills extensively in realising successes as a technology salesperson and project manager an mba student and management consultant 
capacity to learn three years ago i had never heard of wacc i had written a 90th percentile gmat and was on my was to ivey in the time since i have completed the mba achieving top marks in finance marketing and an overall dean 's honour list standing i have taught business courses in russia i have worked at two top consulting firms consulting on a range of projects in various industries i have paddled the yukon river and my wife and i have bought a house and enjoyed the arrival of our first child i am a proactive learner with few limits 
commitment my personal mission statement is to positively impact people by creating and facilitating positive change this core value keeps me highly motivated and interested in being a catalyst for change 
what i am interested in pursuing 
strategic planning and analysis following on what i was doing at monitor i 'm looking around for companies that have an active corporate planning internal consulting group for the prospective employer i bring a valuable set of skills and the rigorous hard-working disposition that is a by-product of the monitor pedigree for me an internal planning or consulting group allows me to keep growing my experience with various businesses or business units in various industries it also allows me to network learn an industry and with the right company transition into line management in the future 
business development i am also attracted to the idea of growing a business primarily because i like generating impact i would be interested in business development roles that combine an element of selling with involvement in the strategic planning process basically the processes of figuring out what to do and where and then doing it 
growing changing industries i am primarily looking in the financial services pharmaceuticals and energy industries

i 'm in toronto wed through fri this week but would like to attend this mtg as i have ideas on the subject how about next monday thanks 
nella please set up meeting this week with le dain zufferli 's gas teams to brainstorm ideas on raising our nat gas volumes eol transactions customers on eol between now and year-end 
i have given bill greenizan formal authority to be your direct supervisor bill will be the point person for any questions development issues and concerns that your group may have you are still welcome to approach me at any time however i feel that given my increased responsibilities with the gas group it would only be fair to the four of you in terms of career development to have more frequent and detailed interaction with bill 
thank you 
p.s. i would like to make this announcement in person but as you know it is difficult to get all four of you at the same time 
we can put him in sean 's seat 
can you procure a seat for greg somewhere near the trading floor preferably close to colin 
looking forward to it 
john cooper 
just to keep you informed we are progressing towards launching the ais demad swap as discussed i have a target date of sep 30 01 to launch this product 
per your suggestions we have changed the product from a peak to flat 7x24 
john we are planning to meet and educate counterparties in alberta to market this product do you think brokers are going to play a role in this please let me know if yes then we will educate them on this product as well 
if you think of some thing that we need to take care of at this time please let me know

the estate 's dpr reporting requirement to risk controls in houston is going to be twice a week consistent with this i would also like to change our internal dpr reporting process for ecc power-estate from daily to twice per week note that curves and an official calc will still be required daily 
i would like to make this change starting feb 1 please let me know if you are okay with this 
kathy 
as a follow up to this email we will start reporting the dpr 's on wednesday 's and monday 's for tuesday and friday valuations the first wednesday will be the 30th of january each day we should expect to report the positions p l and prma of only those transactions we expect to fulfill with the exception of gas susan trevino will be sending the benchmarks to each of the groups for their review 
if anyone anticipates any problems with this time frame please call me or shona to discuss 
chris 
fallon has requested a dpr be prepared 2x a week for positions that we are executing on active live positions only no terminations or deals we are not executing on we have put together the shell of how this dpr will look to start this process we are planning to present to him positions column e and prm value column x as of 1 23 to do this we have laid out the following steps 
we need to get the prm values directly from you column x 
we will run the benchmarks and need to work with you to ensure you are happy with the benchmark numbers we have pulled from rms the exception is gas we need the gas risk group to provide the gas bench to us 
we need all of then exceptions qualifications to your numbers 
we will need the other information in the schedule to be reported to us starting next week but not for this exercise 
please confirm to me shona that you can get us this info by 230 pm today 
lastly i am attaching the unofficialized book list as these books will not make it into the benchmarks and need you to confirm that there are no 3rd party positions in these books 
thanks in advance

subject windows error message haiku 
tokyo japan may 20 sony has announced its own computer operating 
system now available on its hot new portable pc called the vaio 
instead of producing the cryptic error messages characteristic of 
microsoft 's windows and dos systems sony 's chairman asai tawara 
said we intend to capture the high ground by putting a human 
japanese face on what has been until now an operating system 
that reflects western cultural hegemony for example we have 
replaced the impersonal and unhelpful microsoft error messages with 
our own japanese haiku poetry the haiku messages are just as 
informative as microsoft 's and they make you pause just long enough 
that you 're able to fight the impulse to put a fist through the 
screen the chairman went on to give examples of the error messages 
a file that big 
it might be very useful 
but now it is gone 
you seek a web site 
it cannot be located 
countless more exist 
chaos reigns within 
stop reflect and reboot 
order shall return 
aborted effort 
close all that you have worked on 
you ask way too much 
yesterday it worked 
today it is not working 
windows is like that 
first snow then silence 
this thousand dollar screen dies 
so beautifully 
with searching comes loss 
the presence of absence 
june sales.doc not found 
the tao that is seen 
is not the true tao 
until you bring fresh toner 
windows nt crashed 
the blue screen of death 
no one hears your screams 
stay the patient course 
of little worth is your ire 
the network is down 
a crash reduces 
your expensive computer 
to a simple stone 
three things are certain 
death taxes and lost data

oati says that version 1.7 is drastically different from the current software and training is highly recommended i was thinking that it would be a good idea to send one of us to the 2-day training session and then that person could pass on the information to the other 3 i think by the sounds of it we would only need to attend one day since the second day deals with the nerc policy for the eastern interconnect only 
there is a training session that runs on october 1-2 in minneapolis i am off those days and would be more then happy to attend i can take care of all the registration and travel planning with angela if you would like 
the cost of the session is 250 for 2 days or 150 for the first day only there are only 8 spots left for this session 
let me know what you think

can you re-activate the alberta power pool access to enrononline although this entity doesn 't trade it is important that they have access to the alberta gas and 
alberta power product for view only this is a government entity that controls important gas generators in the province they use our info about aeco gas in dispatching these units and they are an advocate for electricity trading in the province therefore they need to see the alberta power market data on eol

i didn 't see accumap added to the new list that was sent by chris behney 
the nova oasis and power pool of alberta accounts that were added in yellow were inappropriately added as these are 
not data sources that require purchasing they are simply accounts to set-up much like a membership account

the balancing pool committed in the their beginning of year release to dispatch milner as follows 
70 mw 0 
50 mw 35.49 
milner has been down for maintenance until recently 
since coming back from maintenace the 50 mw block 35.49 has disappeared we analyzed the offer stack and it appears 
that milner has the full 120 mw 0 
i called doug heath to discuss this he hasn 't called me back 
the issue i raised last week about sherness dispatch is ok i received a justified answer however this milner issue is harder for th pool to defend

lance armstrong 
throughout the tour de france a colombian rider on the kelme costa 
blanca team santiago botero had been keeping a diary for the newspaper 
each day the newspaper published his diary from the previous day 
unfortunately this is the only diary entry i have seen it is worth the 
read 
there i am all alone with my bike i know of only two riders ahead of me 
as i near the end of the second climb on what most riders consider the 
third worst mountain stage in the tour i say most riders because i do 
not fear mountains after all our country is nothing but mountains i 
train year-round in the mountains i am the national champion from a 
country that is nothing but mountains i trail only my teammate fernando 
escartin and a swiss rider pantani one of my rival climbers and the 
gringo armstrong are in the peleton about five minutes behind me i am 
climbing on such a such a steep portion of the mountain that if i were to 
stop pedaling i would fall backward even for a world class climber 
this 
is a painful and slow process i am in my upright position pedaling at a 
steady pace willing myself to finish this climb so i can conserve my 
energy 
for the final climb of the day the kelme team leader radios to me that 
the 
gringo has left the peleton by himself and that they can no longer see 
him 
i recall thinking the gringo cannot catch me by himself 
a short while later i hear the gears on another bicycle within seconds 
the gringo is next to me riding in the seated position smiling at me 
he was only next to me for a few seconds and he said nothing he only 
smiled and then proceeded up the mountain as if he were pedaling 
downhill 
for the next several minutes i could only think of one thing his 
smile 
his smile told me everything i kept thinking that surely he is in as 
much 
agony as me perhaps he was standing and struggling up the mountain as i 
was and he only sat down to pass me and discourage me he has to be 
playing 
games with me not possible the truth is that his smile said everything 
that his lips did not his smile said to me i was training while you 
were 
sleeping santiago it also said i won this tour four months ago 
while 
you were deciding what bike frame to use in the tour 
i 
trained harder than you did santiago i don 't know if i am better than 
you but i have outworked you and right now you cannot do anything about 
it enjoy your ride santiago see you in paris 
obviously the gringo did not state any of this but his smile did dispel 
a 
bad rumor among the riders on the tour the rumor that surfaced as we 
began 
the prologue several days ago told us that the gringo had gotten soft 
his 
wife had given birth to his first child and he had won the most difficult 
race in the world he had no desire to race to win i imagine that his 
smile turned to laughter once he was far enough not to embarrass me the 
gringo has class but he heard the rumors he probably laughed all the 
way 
to paris he is a great champion and i must train harder i am not 
content 
to be a great climber i want to be the best 
i learned much from the gringo in the mountains i will never forget the 
helpless feeling i had yesterday if i ever become an international 
champion i will always remember the lesson the gringo taught me 
ok 
it seems tuesday next week is also a problem i now propose friday july 27 1 30 calgary time please advise

your numbers amount to a adjustment of 1,746,675 were the total 2nd order from jun 29 was 1,891,851 now i understand that i would receive a some negative 2nd order to explain some of this difference i just thought that 145,176 difference i.e. 1,891,851-1,746675 which should be the true 2nd order was a bit high 
i wanted to update you on what we have found regarding the liquidations for the financial options and the 2nd order the problem began at the end of june when coding in enpower was changed for how the delta was reported for put options only this change to the delta did not carry through to the liquidation values for and as a result the options were liquidating showing a loss instead of a gain this resulted in large losses in 2nd order because the p l that could not be explained due to the incorrect liquidations was placed there the it group is working to fix the problem which should be done in the next day or two until then karim and myself will manually reflect the correct liquidations and p l in the dpr until enpower is fixed going forward starting with july 18th p l 
karim and i have figured the p l adjustment that needs to be made for july and the last day of june the total adjustment is 1,746,675 as follows 
july 1,529,869 july 1 17 
june 29th 216,806 
the july adj was captured on july 17th p l the june adjustment needs to be captured as pma adjustment as result of the dpr being incorrect for june against the financial liquidations report the liq rec should be out of balance by at least the adjustment noted above an fyi for accounting the financial liquidations report is reporting the correct liquidations numbers for any financial put options the problem lies within the enpower portcalc not the financial liq report and that is why the lic rec should be out of balance 
john 
the total 2nd order up to and including july 16 is 1,891,851 
john 
i just got of the phone with postlethwaite and he said we will make the adjustment tommorow morning before the final dpr s the correction should add approx 1.5 million in p l. sorry for the delay in resolving the issue 
i also found out that you had no liquidations in june 
and had 22,000 in liquidations in may in your options book these amounts do not take into consideration any premiums 
do these s seem right to you i am going off what postlethwaite has told me 
karim i don 't want to wait till month end let 's adjust the numbers now and for the june 29 2nd order lets take that value into june since it relates to july puts 
hi everyone 
i just got of the phone with hai and he told me how to make an adjustment on a day to day basis in regards to incorrect liquidations but he also explained this is just to make the daily p l s right if nothing were done the month end p l would still somehow work out because adjustments would be made does this mean that for june and for a certain portion of july we should not do anything and just make adjustments on a going forward basis and assume everything will work out at month end 
if this is the case i would like someone to walk me through june to see if the numbers did really work themselves out as there was a large swing in second order on june 29 that was not adjusted for 
let me know if one of you could help me do this 
karim 
evidently this a problem that stacey white has been aware of for a couple of months now there was a change made in the coding for the delta position and this has somehow messed up the liq value 
john 
john karim 
i 'm now looking closely at the option liquidation problems i believe that there might be a sign-flipping problem for puts that s causing this whole issue i 'll keep you posted

hi john 
with reference to article 5 section 5.1 b are we going to propose an alternative planned outage to tau for next year 
thanks 
mike 
the purpose of this email is to address some of the questions you may 
have regarding the gold sector 
gold stocks are way ahead of the gold price what 's going on 
the us dollar remains strong how can gold rally 
how can gold stocks rally when inflation remains so tame 
the following charts found in the attached word document sourced 
from bloomberg illustrate the relationship of gold stocks and bullion 
to several other important variables us crb cpi and tse metals 
and minerals index 
we hope that you will agree with our conclusions that based on the 
response of these variables at the end of the last recession 
1 it is reasonable to see bullion lag the gold stocks in this 
economic environment end of fed easing 
2 gold gold stocks can rally in the face of a strong us dollar

hi john 
i have a commitment signed application from the client to contract for power from enron direct i now need to fix the price with you i had given the attached spreadsheet to jason last week and the load following ratio was calculated at 1.12 to the flat block pricing 
the power flow date is july 20 2001 and ends at 0 00 a.m. on august 1 2002 
the data on the spreadsheet is the notional quantity of power in kw for each day by hour ending by month 
total annual consumption is 3,778,235 kw 
normally i would get jason or shawn to give me the price but i understand they are out of the office for the afternoon 
please advise me if you need anything else 
thanks

dear participants 
i 'm writing to provide you with an update on our progress to launch the 
automated dispatch and messaging system or adams for short in my may 25 
note i outlined the efficiency benefits of the new system and attached a 
copy of our tentative implementation schedule 
since then we 've been busy testing the product to make sure it meets the 
power pool 's standards for quality and the expectations of our 
participants and to be frank at this point in time it doesn 't quite 
measure up we feel we 'd be jeopardizing the quality of the product to meet 
the timeline and that 's not the way we do business instead we 've decided 
to shift the launch to early september 2001 the change will also provide 
additional time for participants to prepare especially during the summer 
holiday season and allow for more one-on-one training with individual 
participants as requested 
our technical staff will be contacting you in july to ensure you can 
connect to the system and receive test dispatches also we will contact 
you with a firmer implementation schedule as we approach september 
in the meantime if you have any questions please feel free to contact 
either myself at 403 233-6491 or your respective participant liaison

this is not just a july 6 issue before june 29 my 2nd order effects have been less thatn 15000 cdn 
for the following days my 2nd order effects have been 
june 29 c 216,729 
july 2 c 140,533 
july 3 c 212,285 
july 5 c 117,156 
july 6 c 385,535 
july 9 c 264,504 
what is going on can you explain 
the following is a summary of our findings regarding the high 2nd order for option deal 638008 effective date july 6 previous date july 5 
the total deal daily change -172899 is correct 
the historical greeks and curve shift are correct they add up to -62084 
the daily liquidation value 196872 is not correct and is pushing the 2nd order to a very high highly negative amount upon examining the option liquidation report we find that there is 43680 in liquidation and 153192 in expiring options 
this totals to 196872 the issue is the expiring options are no longer part of the option 's effective date value and they were part of the previous date 's value since they hadn 't expired yet therefore the liquidation values should be 
liq 43680 
expired 153198 
which totals to a negative value of -109512 if we use this value -109512 in the daily liquidation column which arguably could be split between liquidation and expiry instead of the current value 196872 which results in a second order value of -1297 
we are still discussing the causes and implications of this issue please let us know if you have any further questions or if you have any issues with this explanation

i sent you an update of the hedge summary for july 3 2001 
in that i mentioned that i bought 125 mw of cal02 at 10 hr flat i am long over 500 mw at this heat rate the biggest risk in this position is a large hydro year that 
tanks the mid-c i.e. uncorrelated event with gas mid-c off-peak is 47 usd nymex fixed price for cal02 is 3.79 usd and sumas basis is 0.16 for cal02 this implies a heat rate of close to 
11.9 for the off-peak mid-c 
i am thinking about buying back some aeco gas hedge for cal02 then selling mid-c off-peak to replace the gas hedge perhaps as winter blow-out protection buy some jan-feb sumas basis 
the trade for a 25 mw long alberta flat position would be 
a sell 25 mw of mid-c off-peak 
b buy 0.25 contracts day of aeco fixed price cal02 gas i.e. to unwind the off-peak alberta portion of the the gas hedge 
c buy 0.25 contracts day of sumas jan-feb basis 
see what you think

the implementation of the automated dispatch messaging system adms from 
the power pool of alberta is proceeding on schedule however the processes 
for implementation and training are changing slightly as described below 
the purpose of this memo is to inform all of the participants who have been 
contacted for the implementation of adms of the processes over the next few 
weeks and the requirements for the implementation at your dispatch 
locations 
beginning the week of july 2 2001 and continuing through july 13 2001 
power pool staff will be contacting you individually to provide you with 
your username and password and ensure that you are able to log into the web 
site this initial web site will be on a development system that is not 
connected to the active market system this will enable participants to log 
onto the system to become familiar with the screens and user features as 
well as receive test dispatches 
beginning the week of july 16 2001 the power pool will turn off the 
development system web server and transfer to the active market system the 
system controller area will contact each participant and walk you through 
the screens and answer any questions that you may have regarding use of the 
system once you are familiar with the system through this conversation 
future active dispatches will then be provided over the adms system the 
sequential addition of participants to the system will enable the orderly 
transfer from the voice dispatch process to the automated process with a 
minimum of disruption in the dispatch process 
the above process changes the manner in which training will be provided in 
reviewing the user screens we believe that participants will be able to 
understand how to use the system simply by having access to the system prior 
to the implementation if there is any difficulties encountered using the 
system the system controllers will be available to assist you with any 
questions as your users begin to use the dispatch system 
the majority of you have indicated that your computer equipment is in place 
and that you are ready to start implementation if you are unable to start 
the implementation process on july 2 2001 please let the power pool 
contact know and he will arrange to schedule your user names passwords and 
access closer to july 16 2001 
the implementation of digital certificates to enhance the security of the 
system will be delayed for a short period of time to enable a newer and 
simpler digital certificate system we believe that by implementing without 
the digital certificates fewer implementation problems will be encountered 
and will also simplify the digital certificate installation process with 
users at a later date our implementation of username and password 
protection combined with server certification provides adequate security in 
the short term before the digital certificates are incorporated 
as we discussed the system provides audible alerts for the users when a 
dispatch is received i am attaching six files that contains audible alert 
sounds for you to load on your computers to install these .wav files on 
your computers create a folder 
c ppoa admin sounds 
and copy these files to the new folder your internet browser will then use 
these files for the audible alerts that are provided by the system you can 
review this with the person who will be contacting you with usernames and 
passwords if there is difficulty implementing these alert sounds 
as the implementation portion of the adms project moves to the operational 
area of the power pool contact points with the power pool will change 
effective immediately would you please use the following contact names for 
work on the adms implementation

i tried to answer you but my response was returned undelivered basically the pool is agnostic it pays power producers for the pyhsical energy delivered to the grid and it charges power consumers for energy taken from the grid any financial arrangements between the buyers and sellers are not known to the pool the only mechanism the pool uses for physical power transactions is the direct sale mechanism the terms and volume of these direct sales are entered in the pool 's trading system the pool then subracts the volume of the direct sale from the consumers and producers meter and pays charges the producer consumer on the net volume i.e actual production-direct sales or actual consumption-direct sales 
john 
can you shed some light 
derek john 
quick question from what i have read it appears as though the way the power pool works the pool settles with the buyers and sellers each month however what happens when we contract with a counterparty directly does the pool collect payment due for energy delivered under a bilateral contract and then forward payment onto the supplying party or does the financial settlement occur directly between enron and the counterparty please advise

financial settlement occurs between enron and the customer the pool is agnostic to what its participants do i.e. generators that do 3rd party physical hedge are still paid by the pool consumers of electricity who do 3rd party physical hedges also pay the pool

group 
going forward we will be transacting with enron canada corp on an over-the-counter basis we will provide them with a bid and an offer suitable for non-firm energy trades enron canada will contact us each morning to inquire about possibilities for export and import we should be familiar with the alberta power pool forecast and be aware of the conversion from cdd to usd the lead or nw trader will provide enron canada with their estimate or feel of the market each morning and throughout the day 
enron canada will be trying to obtain non-firm transmission nearly every hour we need to tell them if this is an unwise practice from a risk-reward standpoint based on our understanding of the market as they will lose around 7 per mw cdd on unused transmission with zero chance for return 
further enron canada wants the opportunity to transact with other counterparties at the bc border they will give us the first look but if we cannot use their energy they will contact wwp ipc transalta or other counterparty in an attempt to recoup some of their loss i do not see a need for this and i think it leaves us open to tainted customer relationships financial loss and embarrassment if we are in contact with enron canada before the fact start of the day top of the hour etc we should be able to get them the best price for their energy be very clear in your dealings with nw counterparties that you are buying or selling a non-firm product determine a book-out price to solve problems with physical flow if necessary we are basically buying a put or a call and should pay our counterparty appropriately

john 
john lavorato already said that he would make jd report directly to canada 
john one thing to consider with your nat gas org is the reporting of disturnal to john arnold from my standpoint this was an unfortunate move and is similar to us losing the east gas desk to houston you will want to give this careful consideration particularly if you are looking to disturnal to trade alberta power options with the change in leadership we should discuss whether we want to grab disturnal back solid line reporting and suggest dotted line to arnold 
fyi his p l for accounting purposes continues to roll-up to canada however for internal mgmt reporting his p l rolls up to arnold 
here are my comments on the original guarantee

these are the heat rates that i am referencing in the hedge summary sheet 
if you look at the cal 03-cal 10 period you see that there are roughly 25,000,000 mwh two days ago 1 had only 6.5 contracts day hedged 
in the past two days i sold 2.5 contracts day in the past two days the cal 03-10 swap has increased c 0.47

i was wondering why i am not eligible yet i sent gave my agreement forms to tricia henry yesterday 
1 for a full requirements deal i would like some sense of the load shape of the customer having just monthly total energy consumption is not enough to price a deal 
2 the all requirements price may be less or greater than the peak price it is dependent on load shape 
3 that is correct 
john 
i would like to clarrify how the load following deals for electricity look i understand that you are willing to price full load following deals for ed customers for both cummulative and interval meter sites 
1 what information do you require us to provide you to price a full requirements deal we generally see 12 months of average monthly consumption for cummulative meter sites do you need to know which utility the customer is with i.e. for nsls purposes 
2 how would an all requirements price compare to a peak hour price 
3 if you were to provide us with a full requirements deal i am assuming that ed would charge pay ecc for the delta between the fixed price and the pool price 
the ed standard contract currently does not contemplate a true all requirements deal the standard deal structure being used for cummulative meter sites is for a fixed price volume block of power and for interval meter sites it is a defined volume by hour of the day for weekdays and weekends by calendar month 
we would appreciate clarrification from you 
many thanks

we have traditionally have had currency issues in canada regarding p l preservation versus cashflow preservation 
we have been valued in p l under the us but due to revenue canada reasons our functional currency has been c i.e. the preponderence of cashflows were in c from the legacy gas deals petrocanada suncour etc and the ppa position since trader evaluation at year end has been in us traders would hedge c positions immediately as the trade occured the hedge would extend until the position rolled of his book from a p l systems point of view this would preserve the trader 's p l in us however from a treasury point of view currency risk would still exist until cash exchange hands these cash exchange dates were different for financial trades physical trades and inter-company trades there was also some currency risk albeit small between billing dates from sap and settlement dates of the respective trade type 
it is my opinion that the functional currency should match the evaluation currency in order to mitigate many of the above problems to a certain extent i am indifferent if it is us or c 
the timeline of the decision is being driven by our accounting group who need to set up the sap system they are trying to work within a deadline to have the company capable of performing transactions by jan 29 this is the date that they have been told to meet by houston as a result we would need a determinination of the functional currency by mon jan 28 
you should request this from eric ledain or derek davies they have the current list 
john 
please provide the list of canadian originators 
thank you

wow that was higher than i thought that is not much different than mine and higher than other directors in the office i am not blowing smoke but given my experience there is nothing that i can do at the immediate time 
175,000 
i don 't even know your salary now 
has there been any real explanation why it is no one small difference between the two is i am not talking about an equalization between c and us salaries mine is just simply a case of enron paying under market because they could in the past i don 't believe that is the case anymore two years ago i was willing to accept less than market to see behind the curtain but that is no longer the case i am not saying that it needs to be in the ubs document but i would need your word you would do everything in your power to fix it if you can honestly tell me that i am paid the max. that is available to directors i will drop it 
i am reading your mail i have asked for the same thing regarding my base especially since i came up here with a base salary converted at 1.48 cdn usd and with no raise since being here at 1.61 cdn usd i have received a 9 pay cut relative to my peers in houston not to mention that my base salary is 50- 100 usd year lower than what other shops are offering however after three attempts i have been unsuccessful in championing my own cause 
zuff 
just a quick note after my first look at the numbers the only concern i have is with the base number seeing as there is no money up front the future payments look a lot more like long term comp. than any real signing or retention bonus when i came to enron two years ago i took a 35,000 decrease in base pay in exchange for options and the opportunity to trade for number 1 that is no longer the case no options and ubs is not 1 therefore i would look for my base to better reflect market on a go forward basis if you are able to accommodate a reasonable adjustment in base i would be very excited about the opportunity to sign with ubs 
i would like to talk about this on monday after i have had a chance to look at the paper in full

markets 
my marks show how we believe the market would trade if the market were open today considering neighboring markets transmission wheeling costs and fuel costs more of a expected liquidation value vs. the current ontario market players bids and offers 
the market on 3yr 7x24 is being shown by a broker 46- 48 and on the wholesale side i doubt the bid is actually there or if so it is only a piece deep 50mw 
as a result i would show an actually two way of 43- 47.50 and be coming from the sell side to the industrial customers who may pay in the 46- 47 range 
peak my 3yr mark is 52 but given the often bullish nature of new markets i would be a bid for this summer and then look to offer the 3yr in the low fifties upcoming changes in the ontario system nodal vs. zonal pricing would have an effect on these term deals 
staffing and services 
trading 
on the trading side i will need to rehire personnel for the roles we laid off an analyst and a temp it programmer for fundies development analyst wise i am interested in bringing brian loy back if he is still available he has a good knowledge of the nug contracts and is a good fit for a trading desk as our need for providing imo energy and operating reserve services bidding for specific nugs and dispatchable loads grows it may be a good idea to bring heather mcillmurray over from the settlements group i have had initial discussions with richard crouch paul devries and heather on this matter 
origination 
this is your area of expertise i would suggest two originators and an analyst if dan dorland is staying he could continue on the origination side providing education to our new origination team and being the analyst to assist the oefc-nug point personnel brian loy 's previous role 
it 
implementing the trading and vms systems is a very important issue where timing will become an issue i would suggest a short term 6mo contract with mike marryott to manage the system 's side of this process and to integrate with the estate and netco on trading and settlements systems specifically david posten 's vms team his location should be in toronto 
let 's get on these issues as soon as possible 
on specific personnel i would have liked to have retained jeff borg and chris gaffney 
office space 
tembec our neighbor on this floor has often indicated that they are interested in some of our office space if that interest remains we could examine leasing all of the space passed the flat screens the origination desk pod one conference room and storage area not to include our server room this would leave us with space for up to 24 people two conference rooms kitchen as an alternative we could consider moving upstairs into the enron direct location 
potential conflict of interest 
i would suggest releasing employees that will not be part of estate or ubs relatively soon specifically the group that is leaving here but will be participating in the ontario market ubs ontario information and resources are proprietary and confidential if personnel are being kept on to wind-down specific activities their access to ubs power gas curves should be restricted 
as time becomes available we should get together and discuss ontario 's business plan 
thank you 
garrett 
garrett i take that these are your mids where would your 3yr two-way be 
cad peak 7x24 
1yr 50.00 42.75 
3yr 52.00 44.00 
5yr 52.50 44.00 
i can 't afford to bump anyone unfortunately all the people on this list are top notch we are trying to separate the cream from the cream given that and working on the assumption that dan d is a rock star i.e. not knowing him from adam otherwise i think we should relace lalani with him 
guys i believe dan would like to go to ubs i 'm not sure that i will be successful at moving our headcount up to accomodate him any thoughts on who we would bump the current list is as follows headcount 20

cooper is doing fine he is still breathing according to him 
things are going well here we have been working on cleaning up dec i cautiously optimistic about ubs i think the fact that they put no money up front could make things difficult with the creditors i am not sure if they will accept the fact that will only get money from profits that we make there are no guarantees that we will be profitable 
yeah the last few weeks are hard i am sure she is at the point she just wants it over with are you ready for your life to get flipped around it 's a lot of fun but difficult for the first 2 months after that it get 's easier as you go 
so i assume you are riding it out with ubs not sure how i feel about the situation could be just the fear of the unknown 
how is cooper doing

things are going well hectic but more steady now that we are bought by ubs at least steady in mind 
jess is doing well just 6 weeks left she is getting to the uncomfortable phase now

dad asked if i wanted to lend you some money but i am reluctant to do it at 
this point in time since 
a i am not completely at liberty to touch all the cash that i have 
received lately for concern that it may be taken bank under potential 
creditor action against enron unfortunatelty without this cash i really 
can 't afford to lend any the cash that i received recently represents 80 
of the cash that i have and i am not sure when i can count on this cash 
with any degree of certainty therefore i am reluctant to touch this 
money for at least 6 months 
b as of right now i don 't have a job after feb 28 the new company deal 
that enron is trying to structure with its traders and a new buyer will not 
be 
done until the month if this deal falls through then i have to find a 
job with another company in this case it is most likely that i will have 
to move back to the 
us since my contacts and the most lucrative opportunities i.e. compared 
the the new enron deal are there 
c if i had the cash to give dad asked that i could give you a discount to 
the bank mortgage with discount rates near 5 even if i gave you a 
mortgage at 
4 i don 't think the monthly interest saving for you would be material 
enough 
d i think it is good for you to develop a credit rating with a bank 
through a mortgage it is very beneficial for later on in life paying 
visa bills does help you a bit in this 
category but not like a mortgage 
hopefully you can get the financing from a bank i think that this is the 
best solution in the long run 
-----original message----- 
hi john 
wanted to talk to you about the house stuff dad told me that he was 
talking to you about financing options i just wanted to say that i 
don 't 
want you to feel compelled to write a mortgage for me dad 's just 
trying 
to explore different options i know it 's a lot of cash and i would 
never 
want to impose on you i 'm sure that i can get a mortgage from the bank 
at 
a decent rate as long as i can put down the 25 down payment so that i 
can 
avoid the mortgage insurance which is costly i 'm cashing in some gics 
and other bonds and ali 's going to lend me 10k so i will be able to 
come 
up with the 55k for the down payment 
if writing the mortgage is something that you would like to do for a 
stable 
investment then we can talk too my time horizon on the condo is 5-7 
years so i recognize that that would hold up your capital for a long 
while anyway i have to go ahead and get the guarantee of financing 
within 5 days or so so i have to make a decision in the next day either 
way maybe you can call or email me

if the legacy deals move to netco then we need the ability to trade canadian gas canada would not be out of business if we only traded us denominated financial products but it reduce our daily transactions by 75 
john 
dealing with canadian issues and netco original thought was that legacy deals go away and we can do in canada as we do in us unfortunately feedback is that currency issue will still exist in your minds eye will it put canada out of biz if we require that during first 45 days only us like transactions occur 
your feedback would be great 
thanks

hey there dad told me that you got your bonus congratulations that 's 
a piece of good news at least 
i got some bad news about bonuses today we usually get them paid out 
this week but we just got an email from our ceo saying that only a few 
exceptional performers will get some sort of bonus but they won 't 
disclose the information until the end of january given that i have to 
have a new place to live for february i don 't think that i 'll be able buy 
a condo anymore the bonus money would have been for the down payment 
anyway kind of annoying but i guess i should be grateful that i have a 
job

this on to jess

tim and john i wanted to touch base with you regarding a problem that we have run into between eol and a trader having multiple trading books eol has been set up to have a trader associated with one and only one trading book in the stack manager as a result when creating the interface between eol and enpower we can cannot assign multiple trading books to one person david poston in the enpower it support group in houston has been working with the eol group and has come up with a solution 
1 if you definitely plan to be trading on eol for all trading books associated with your name eol it can define certain products to each trading book if this is the approach that you would like to take i will need a list of what products you want to trade and to which trading book they are affiliated with 
2 the other option is that you will just use one trading book under your name if that is the case no changes will have to be made 
if the plan is to use the first option please let me know so we can make the changes and do the necessary testing on this

i think the ymca has a class that is for people recovering from heart-attacks 
i remeber something about that 
i don 't know about the heart classes i 'll look into it but her dr ravi 
isn 't offering up any suggestions or anything she saw him before the 
surgery in august and he said things were okay i really don 't think he 's 
too helpful 
she is lazy but it really frustrates me that she doesn 't want to help 
herself i told her that not walking is like not taking her heart 
medication that didn 't seem to resonate dad is going to go to the ymca 
tomorrow and maybe get a membership for both of them they have a walking 
track there at least it 's something to do in the winter when she was 
down this weekend we walked around the craft show at the exhibition

hi john 
how was thanksgiving was the baby shower fun 
i was wondering if you 'd have some time to read over ali 's chicago 
essays 
later tonight he 's going to submit them on wednesday let me know if 
that 's okay do you have a printer at home can i send them to your 
home 
account i don 't think ali will be done before about 8pm or so 
tonight 
ps we need to talk about mom i saw her this weekend she 's gained 
a 
lot of weight and hasn 't been exercising at all dad 's pretty 
frustrated 
because all she does is watch tv i had a talk with her yesterday 
telling 
her that she has more risk of having a heart attack if she doesn 't walk 
exercise than if she exerts herself when exercising i think she 's 
afraid 
of having a heart attack while exercising we need to do something 
she 's 170lbs now and should be at around 140lbs to be healthy
